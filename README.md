# Single-MAC-Pipelined-VLSI-Architecture-for-Real-Time-Signal-Image-Processing
project presents a high-performance, pipelined VLSI architecture utilizing a single Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit for efficient real-time signal and image processing. Designed to optimize area, speed, and power consumption, the architecture supports a range of DSP operations such as filtering andÂ convolution.
In This project we used single MAC by reputations.At the output end we achieved 1.Less Time delay 2.Low Power Consumption 3.Less Dynamic Area
